## Contribute to code

> [!NOTE]
> Grafana k6 Studio is currently in active development. Most of the features are meant to be implemented by the team, so we may or may not accept contributions from the community.

1. Create a fork and open a feature branch
2. Sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/grafana/k6-studio) (the process is integrated with the pull request flow through cla-assistant.io).
3. Create a pull request. Make sure to include a description of the changes you made, and reference the issue number if applicable. The PR title should be descriptive and follow the [commit message format](#commit-message-format). Make sure to fill the PR template with the information we need to review your PR.
4. GitHub will assign reviewers to your pull request. We will review your PR and provide feedback. We may ask you to make changes or improvements to your code. Once your PR is approved, a maintainer will merge it.

### Commit message format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages. This helps us to automate the release process and generate changelogs.

Additionally, we have the following rules:

- Use a complete sentence for your commit message/PR title. The PR title will appear in the changelog, so the message should give a good idea of what the change is about.
- Start with an imperative verb. Example: `Add type column to WebLogView`
  - **Exception:** if the PR fixes a bug, please describe the bug rather than the fix. Example: `fix: Application crashes when opening a HAR file`
- Use _Sentence case_ for the commit message/PR title. Example: `Add type column to WebLogView` instead of `add type column to WebLogView`
